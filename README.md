# 📂 Amin's Data Analysis & Machine Learning Portfolio

## 👋 Introduction
Hello! I am **Amin**, a **Data Analysis** student at the University of Messina, Italy, currently in my second year of study.  
I specialize in **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and **SQL**, and I'm passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights.

This repository showcases my **projects** in **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and related fields, built during my academic journey and personal exploration. My goal is to pursue a career as a **Machine Learning Engineer** after completing my studies.

## 🔧 Skills
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, numpy
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees
- **SQL**: MySQL, Database Design, Joins, Queries
- **Linux**: Bash Scripting, System Automation
- **C Programming**: Basic Data Structures, File Handling

## 🧑‍💻 Projects
Here are the key projects I have worked on:

1. **[Sales Data Cleaning and Visualization](./Technographic-Analysis-Italy/ItalyB2B.py)**
   - Cleaned and visualized sales data to identify key business insights.
   - Tools used: Python (pandas, matplotlib), SQL.
   
2. **[Customer Database Management](./ecommerce-database-project/Ecommerce.sql)**
   - Designed and managed a relational database for customer information.
   - Tools used: MySQL, SQL Workbench.

3. **[Housing Price Prediction](./Machine_Learning/Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb)**
   - Applied machine learning to predict housing prices based on various features.
   - Tools used: Python (scikit-learn, matplotlib).

4. **[Customer Churn Prediction](./Machine_Learning/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb)**
   - Predicted customer churn using classification algorithms.
   - Tools used: Python (scikit-learn, pandas).

5. **[Linux Bash Automation Script](./Linux/Backup_Script.sh)**
   - Automated system tasks such as file backups using bash scripting.
   - Tools used: Linux, Bash.

6. **[Address Book in C](./C_Projects/AddressBook.c)**
   - Created a simple address book management system using C.
   - Tools used: C Programming, GCC Compiler.

## 🌱 Learning Journey
I am constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects and online courses. I’ve completed a **Machine Learning** certification on Coursera and continuously build new projects to expand my knowledge. 

Currently, I am focused on **deepening my understanding of machine learning models** and **SQL optimization** to handle more complex datasets.
